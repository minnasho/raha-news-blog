  "date": "2020-01-01",
  "content": "We recommend using Static Generation (with and without data) whenever possible because your page can be built once and served by CDN, which makes it much faster than having a server render the page on every request.\n\nYou can use Static Generation for many types of pages, including:\n\n    Marketing pages\n    Blog posts\n    E-commerce product listings\n    Help and documentation\n\nYou should ask yourself: \"Can I pre-render this page ahead of a user's request?\" If the answer is yes, then you should choose Static Generation.\n\nOn the other hand, Static Generation is not a good idea if you cannot pre-render a page ahead of a user's request. Maybe your page shows frequently updated data, and the page content changes on every request."
